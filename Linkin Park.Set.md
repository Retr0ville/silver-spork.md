____A place for my head____

### Recommendations 
are based mainly on personal opinion, lightweight(utility per kb),  offline preference, material/modern design, zero ad tolerance, few to 0 notification intent spamming, and there're just some apps that are objectively the best at what they do even If they fall short of the other parameters,

#### PDF reader: Xodo :  
lightweight, has most of features adobe would request premium acc for and arguably does it all better. At half the size and free

#### Photo Editor (professional): Snapseed: 
objectively the best in this category plus free.

#### Photo Editor (casual): Google photos app, yea I know, Google again but the simplicity at which you could knock off a professional looking edit on the app is probably unmatched.

 #### Gallery app: Google photos app:
 at this point you could attribute anything image management on mobile to Google I guess. They even got the gcam. (Gallery Go is my personal preference though, but ye still google.)

#### Keyboard app : Gboard,
 yes google again, shoosh

#### Video Editing: KineMaster pro: 
desktop level video editing on mobile, Power Director by Cyberlink close second

#### Todo app: Stuff :
 probably the only Todo app that actually made me 'todo' stuff.. also never really saw a need for a Todo app to exceed 2mb so this is right up there. (Buy pro version for cool customization options) 

#### Streaming: All tresh :)
but objectively speaking if you got expensive headphones and want full lossless go for Tidal, if you got an apple device go for AM and every other human Spotify, personal preference Spot+YT music cos google's recommendations algorithm >> 

#### Browser:
 everyone's got a decent enough device to run chrome these days I guess.. and if you are not everyone I'd recommend Via: it's literally <300kb but it's got features that makes me question the size sometimes 

#####Video streaming: :) 

#### Offline music player: Black player,
 one of the best one, and also mostly personal preference. stellio had a neat UI too but I'm not sure they ve fixed their bugs from 3yrs ago when I used it.

#### Calculator: Natural scientific calculator: 
unmatched combination of design and functionality in a calculator.. if you want a calculator with more functions than you'll ever need in a lifetime though HiPER calc's got you

#### File Manager: 
there's a ton of good ones so I'm going by size + functionality + user friendliness to say FX with Cx being a close second.

#### Manual Video Camera: mcpro24fps
 I don't think any other comes close..

####Video compression: Video panda: 
objectively the best on the store

#### VPN: turbo VPN lite,
no need for a vpn to be more than a 5 mb, if you want a bit more options tunnelbear is pretty good

Bonus, :
#### Anime streaming : Zoro.to :
 probably objectively the best with most of the other ones being banned

#### Manga reader : Tachyomi:
 most people already know this

#### Light novel reader: LN Reader :
 Basically Tachyomi but for light novels, not on the playstore for obvious reasons. Go to the GitHub repo to download it.
