Dark is the absence of light 
Hate of love
Silence of sound
Fear of courage
Order of disorder
Death the absence of life..
And I'm not even cherry picking there a lot more examples

The Good is inherently a force against the bad 
We are collectively cognitively biased in concluding that the universe is chaotic by nature when in reality chaos spelt 'good' was enforcd ob the universe for a definitive amount of time.. 

The universe resting state is equilibrium where equilibrium equals all things we Label as bad. And the heat death will invariably bring back that order.. ofc we'll all be long gone before then from Andromeda crashing into us while our sun simultaneously implodes somewhere on the horizon.
Cheers
