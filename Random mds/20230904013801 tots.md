Dark is the absence of light 
Hate of love
Silence of sound
Fear of courage
Order of disorder
Death the absence of life..

The only real state of life is that of good and the absence of good will always be a derivative
And I'm not even cherry picking there a lot more examples

The Good is inherently a force against the bad 
We are collectively cognitively biased in concluding that the universe is chaotic by nature when in reality chaos (read 'good') was enforcd within the universe for a definitive amount of time.. 

The universe's resting state is chaotic where chaos equals all things we Label as bad. And the Heat death will invariably bring back order in equilibrium no matter how much the universe seems to fight against it.. ofc our species will be long gone before then from the spectacle of Andromeda crashing into the Milky way as our sun simultaneously implodes into itself somewhere across the horizon.
