More Information about Redis Stack
----------------------------------

Here some resources to help you quickly get started using Redis Stack. If you still have questions, feel free to ask them in the [Redis Discord](https://discord.gg/redis) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/redisinc).

### Getting Started

1. Sign up for a [free Redis Cloud account using this link](https://redis.info/try-free-dev-to) and use the [Redis Stack database in the cloud](https://developer.redis.com/create/rediscloud).
2. Based on the language/framework you want to use, you will find the following client libraries:
   * [Redis OM .NET (C#)](https://github.com/redis/redis-om-dotnet)
     * Watch this [getting started video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHPXKrJCYNA)
     * Follow this [getting started guide](https://redis.io/docs/stack/get-started/tutorials/stack-dotnet/)
   * [Redis OM Node (JS)](https://github.com/redis/redis-om-node)
     * Watch this [getting started video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUfufrwpBkM)
     * Follow this [getting started guide](https://redis.io/docs/stack/get-started/tutorials/stack-node/)
   * [Redis OM Python](https://github.com/redis/redis-om-python)
     * Watch this [getting started video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPT1FElAS84)

The above videos and guides should be enough to get you started in your desired language/framework. From there you can expand and develop your app. Use the resources below to help guide you further:

1. [Developer Hub](https://redis.info/devhub) - The main developer page for Redis, where you can find information on building using Redis with sample projects, guides, and tutorials.
2. [Redis Stack getting started page](https://redis.io/docs/stack/) - Lists all the Redis Stack features. From there you can find relevant docs and tutorials for all the capabilities of Redis Stack.
3. [Redis Rediscover](https://redis.com/rediscover/) - Provides use-cases for Redis as well as real-world examples and educational material
4. [RedisInsight - Desktop GUI tool](https://redis.info/redisinsight) - Use this to connect to Redis to visually see the data. It also has a CLI inside it that lets you send Redis CLI commands. It also has a profiler so you can see commands that are run on your Redis instance in real-time
5. Youtube Videos
