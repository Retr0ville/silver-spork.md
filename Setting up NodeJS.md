Ever been in a position where you are without your laptop? (*or it died on you unexpectedly for some arcane reason*), while you were in the middle of squashing a ladybug that wouldn't let users successfully sign up on your top of the line website.
>No?
Well okay I admit that was a little too specific. Anyways here's how to use your phone **by which I mean Android** to spin up a fully functional nodeJS environment for all your on the go Server maintenance needs /s.
**First** you would want to 
### Install the Termux app.
You would find a *version* on the Play store but I wouldn't recommend using that as it is outdated, unmaintained and possibly deprecated, so just head over to the official [GitHub Repo here](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases/tag/v0.118.0) and download the latest version *0.118.0* at the time of writing.
Or if you got beef with Microsoft you can as well get the latest version from [Fdroid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/), a great Open source application hosting site for Android.
Okay so what is Termux exactly? You may ask.
Well as the name would imply Termux is a ***Terminal emulator and Linux environment that runs on [Android's Linux kernel ](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2741578/are-android-and-linux-the-same-thing-.html).*** 
Termux combines powerful terminal emulation with an extensive Linux package collection.
